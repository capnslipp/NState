h1. NState

NState is a finite state machine system for the Unity Game Engine, developed by Slippy Douglas for Nectar Games. More info at "nectargames.com/2009/09/09/quest-for-an-event-driven-fsm-and-messaging-system-in-unity-day-one":http://nectargames.com/2009/09/09/quest-for-an-event-driven-fsm-and-messaging-system-in-unity-day-one .

	* NState relies on NEvent ("github.com/slippyd/unity3d-NEvent":http://github.com/slippyd/unity3d-NEvent).
	* NState optionally uses UUnit ("github.com/slippyd/unity3d-UUnit":http://github.com/slippyd/unity3d-UUnit). To remove this dependency, locally delete the "Test" folder.
