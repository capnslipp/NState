NState

NState is an finite state machine system for the Unity Game Engine, developed by Slippy Douglas for Nectar Games.

It relies on NEvent (http://github.com/slippyd/unity3d-NEvent).
It optionally uses UUnit (http://github.com/slippyd/unity3d-UUnit). To remove this dependency, locally delete the "Test" folder.
